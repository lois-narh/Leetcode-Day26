# Swap Nodes in Pairs

This project provides a JavaScript implementation to **swap every two adjacent nodes** in a singly linked list. The operation is performed in-place without modifying the values of the nodes.

---

## Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must do this **in-place**, i.e., **you may not modify the values in the list**, only the nodes themselves may be changed.
